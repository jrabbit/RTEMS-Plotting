privateenv.c:43
Unreachable
free_user_env is never called when (env == &rtems_global_user_env).
This check is done by the caller (rtems_libio_share_private_env) in a different manner as below:
"if (rtems_current_user_env->task_id==current_task_id) {"
This makes sure that free_user_env is not called venv == &rtems_global_user_env

imfs_fifo.c:61
Unreachable
This is an error return path which only returns an error when
pipe_release() returns an error but pipe_release() can't return
an error.  Maybe pipe_release() should be changed to void.
+++

imfs_getchild.c:51
Unreachable
This code cannot be reached. The routine IMFS_find_match_in_dir is
called only if the token type is IMFS_NAME. If ".." is present in the
path, the token type returned by IMFS_get_token would be
IMFS_DIR_UP. With such a setup, IMFS_find_match_in_dir cannot be
called with the name as ".."

Ask Chris Johns
I think he wrote this code and can probably identify the test case.

imfs_mount.c:44
Unreachable?
We need to ask Chris Johns about this. I believe this is a
case where the error checking has been done by the system 
call layer.  I analyzed the "file handlers" callbacks for
guarantees on parameters.  This indicates the same analysis
needs to happen for "file system handlers."
Bharath: Yes, it is checked in mount.c

imfs_debug.c:54
Simple Test Case
Need to do an IMFS_dump on an IMFS filesystem which has a very large
file in it.  I think this is a simple addition to one of the existing
IMFS tests which creates a large file.
+++

imfs_debug.c:88
Simple Test Case
We need to do an IMFS_dump on an IMFS filesystem which has a bad node type
in it.  This may require peeking behind the curtain and changing a
value.
Bharath: But usually, this code is unreachable since we cannot create
a node which is not of type that is checked for.
+++

imfs_rename.c:40
Discuss
I think this is either a simple test or unreachable code.  We need
to discuss this to figure out which.
Bharath: I am not sure how to have a node's parent == NULL.

newlibc_exit.c:89
Simple Test Case
libc_wrapup() is never called when the system state is down.
+++

readv.c:106
Simple Test Case
The count needs to be -1 in one of the requests.  Also add a test for
0 value at the same time since it appears that is a missing branch
condition.
+++

getpwent.c:127
Discuss
I think this is detecting whether or not the read can be fulfilled
from the buffer.  But I am not sure.
+++

getpwent.c:112
Simple Test Case

This is actually the error case at line 103 (*nleft < 2).  I think this
will be hit by having a password entry which does not have enough
characters left in the user's return buffer while something is
being copied into it.
+++

writev.c:104
Simple Test Case
This is a case of needing 0 values in the write iov entries.
+++

writev.c:113
Simple Test Case
This is a case of needing negative values in the write iov entries.
+++

vprintk.c:125
Simple Test Case
0x6f is a 'o'.  It looks like we do not have a printk test which uses %o.

imfs_load_tar.c:112
Simple Test Case
Need to make sure one of the tar tests is configured with the IMFS
and the other is configured with fifoIMFS.
+++

imfs_load_tar.c:151
Simple Test Case
We apparently only have a relative symbolic link.  We need to include
one which has an absolute path. This will be a broken symlink on the
host but resolve fine on the target.
+++

imfs_load_tar.c:169
Medium Test Case
The eval for make must fail.  We will have to ask Jennifer how to
make this call fail.

The script do_coverage now is a living README.  Please see it for
procedural information.  It can perform all steps.  You should only
have to edit VERSIONS-COVERAGE to tailor to your local installation
and run

./do_coverage -?

to get some further advice.  The script catches common errors
and deals with as much as possible.

The report ends up in your test directory (${BSP}-tests).
